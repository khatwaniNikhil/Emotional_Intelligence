4. Start noticing how emotion feels in your body - tingling in legs, cloudy thought/decision making.
5. Practise say to self “'This is what  I'm experiencing, and that's okay, because this is  what I'm going to do about it”

# Concepts
## Intro
1. Better emotion handling - Just saying, avoiding and eating something is not effective in the long term.

## Video 1(Name It to Tame It):
1. emotions are vague, unexplored sensations  - very important to define, name them:
2. mental clarity
3. more power over them
4. can avoid being reactive, feeling helpless and reacting impulsively in ways that mess up our life
5. you will be surprised at how often you're feeling  something, but you're not identifying that feeling
6. Journalling changes brain chemistry, improves emotion processing, and even resolves trauma
7. At times we feel more than one emotion at a same time

## Video 2 Nonjudgmental Attitude
1. Automatic reaction to suppress/not feel good/negative emotions is a bad habit.
2. Vicious Trap cycle: More we suppress the more pressure is there to explode.The more we explode, the more pressure is to suppress.
3. Paradox:  as per research, the more we try to suppress the more we get obsessed over it. Read https://nesslabs.com/pink-elephant-paradox
