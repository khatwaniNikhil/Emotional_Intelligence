acknowledging/feeling emotions and stop suppressing(like: avoid, cope, and distract.)
maintain non-judgmental attitude about emotions - no bad emotions, just comfortable or uncomfortable emotions, exaggerated, distorted, emotions based on falsehood
Start noticing how emotion feels in your body - tingling in legs, cloudy thought/decision making.
Practise say to self “'This is what  I'm experiencing, and that's okay, because this is  what I'm going to do about it”

Video 1(Name It to Tame It):
emotions are vague, unexplored sensations  - very important to define, name them:
mental clarity
more power over them
can avoid being reactive, feeling helpless and reacting impulsively in ways that mess up our life
you will be surprised at how often you're feeling  something, but you're not identifying that feeling
Journalling changes brain chemistry, improves emotion processing, and even resolves trauma
At times we feel more than one emotion at a same time
